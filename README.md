# Memento
Memento is a simple and beautiful note taking app created by harrisuddin and umairrr9.

Memento's Git repo shows that majority of the code has been committed by umairrr9 however we would like to make it clear that both of us have been working together on Visual Studio Code's LiveShare feature.

This app has been deployed at https://mementonotes.herokuapp.com.
